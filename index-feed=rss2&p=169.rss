		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE it! I almost bought one from your shop, but settled on the little notebook set that I did buy from you. I just have to figure out how to make some cash and I can get one of each of everything you make! No, I&#039;m not constructing a shrine (although not a bad idea now that I think of it) but I love everything you do. Everything you make seems to have a touch of magic in it! :)]]></description>
