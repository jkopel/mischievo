		<description><![CDATA[super uber cute! The houses, not the throwing. Well, I suppose the throwing might be cute to some types ... but we try to avoid those, no? Anyhow... they are CUTE! might be interesting to try with pasted together pages of old books? Would that be possible? Hmmmm (by the way I DON&#039;T NEED MORE PROJECTS but)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE it! I almost bought one from your shop, but settled on the little notebook set that I did buy from you. I just have to figure out how to make some cash and I can get one of each of everything you make! No, I&#039;m not constructing a shrine (although not a bad idea now that I think of it) but I love everything you do. Everything you make seems to have a touch of magic in it! :)]]></description>
