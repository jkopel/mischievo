				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a birthday gift for a good friend I made some blind emboss letterpress calling card printed on lusciously soft and thick cotton paper. I also created a custom paper carrying case to hold them. They turned out SO sweet and PERFECT!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the good fortune to visit a paper mill recently as part of my job, and hot damn was that fun and awesomely cool. I have made paper by hand before but seeing a huge industrial paper factory in action was nothing sort of amazing. I was much better able to understand the process (which is essentially the same, just on a MUCH larger scale) having had that prior experience.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was excellent and incredibly knowledgeable about every aspect of the factory. They did not allow any photo taking (which was devastating to me, because there were so many amazing little details and textures i wanted to capture), but I surreptitiously snuck a couple!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My whirlwind trip to NYC several weeks ago was more of a buying trip than anything else. Yes, I went to the <a href="http://www.nationalstationeryshow.com/" target="_blank">stationery show</a>, and that was cool and stuff, but I couldn&#8217;t BUY anything there. So that wasn&#8217;t really as much fun as it could have been.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCdPUfa1e1c/Uduc5-ZoIWI/AAAAAAAAAgI/z2JqJm5y0ik/s1600/NSS01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCdPUfa1e1c/Uduc5-ZoIWI/AAAAAAAAAgI/z2JqJm5y0ik/s640/NSS01.jpg" width="640" height="160" border="0" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<p>I made the rounds as best I could given my available time, location and stamina. There were several trips to <a href="http://www.muji.eu/" target="_blank">MUJI</a>! My hotel was conveniently located near the garment district so I checked out <a href="http://www.mjtrim.com/" target="_blank">M&amp;J</a> and <a href="http://www.tinseltrading.com/index.php" target="_blank">tinsel trading</a>, but my favorite places were the funky ones filled with every crazy kind of elastic and cotton twill in SO many color and sizes and all kinds of awesome things that I wish were more conveniently at my disposal! Also, <a href="http://www.mokubany.com/" target="_blank">mokuba</a> ribbon ooo la la! And I stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.kinokuniya.com/" target="_blank">Kinokuniya</a> one day on my way back the the hotel and found MANY treats there.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gIkfhhSny1w/UdueV0jxXxI/AAAAAAAAAgY/ZF99dWAKgnA/s1600/NSS02.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gIkfhhSny1w/UdueV0jxXxI/AAAAAAAAAgY/ZF99dWAKgnA/s640/NSS02.jpg" width="640" height="160" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>K made a pilgrimage to <a href="http://philstationery.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">phil&#8217;s stationery</a>, which I was hoping would be a dusty treasure trove of delights. It was and it wasn&#8217;t. They were kind of cranky and rather proud of their dusty crap. I did score a stash of onion skin while I was there though.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J-BtGtr3GfQ/Udufqv04P2I/AAAAAAAAAgo/VyJXpUOZrro/s1600/NSS03.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J-BtGtr3GfQ/Udufqv04P2I/AAAAAAAAAgo/VyJXpUOZrro/s640/NSS03.jpg" width="640" height="160" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On my last day I walked <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/" target="_blank">The Highline</a>, which was the highlight of my trip. It was sunny and the birds were chirping and the flowers were blooming and I fell in LOVE</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgA6u8btVIc/Uduiwi12IKI/AAAAAAAAAg4/gnjnMq05HeY/s1600/NSS04.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kgA6u8btVIc/Uduiwi12IKI/AAAAAAAAAg4/gnjnMq05HeY/s640/NSS04.jpg" width="640" height="160" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>After that I made an obligatory trip to <a href="http://www.katespaperie.com/" target="_blank">Kate&#8217;s Paperie</a> and the <a href="http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/StoreCatalogDisplay_-1_10001_10451_" target="_blank">MOMA store</a>, and just enjoyed walking through the city. I ended my day before zooming back up to Times Square on the subway to grab a car to the airport with <a href="http://www.joeshanghairestaurants.com/" target="_blank">soup dumplings in chinatown</a>! <strong>ZOMG!</strong> Best thing EVER. I need to eat more more <strong>MORE</strong> of those.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t talk about pop ups without praising my teacher <a href="http://www.popularkinetics.com/" target="_blank">Carol Barton</a>! While I was at UArts I was fortunate enough to take several classes and workshops with her and I learned <strong>SO</strong> much. She is awesome and if you are interested in learning to create pop ups I highly recommend <a href="http://www.popularkinetics.com/sales_page.html" target="_blank">ANY</a> and <a href="http://www.popularkinetics.com/sales_page.html" target="_blank">ALL</a> of her books.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lqt0C5ppfWM/UbSzNjX5YII/AAAAAAAAAfc/KX2toR8bn70/s1600/popup02.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lqt0C5ppfWM/UbSzNjX5YII/AAAAAAAAAfc/KX2toR8bn70/s320/popup02.jpg" width="275" height="320" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>In preparing to teach my first pop up class last fall I wanted to explore what it is about pop ups that I love. I like pop ups of all kinds, but the ones I really love to <strong>MAKE</strong> are more architectural in nature. I like the shapes and the shadows and my aesthetic naturally leans toward the graphic.</p>
<p>I have had a blast making cards for my friends and I was recently thrilled to received a commission for a set of twelve cards. Time to get busy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The <a href="http://www.printinghistory.org/programs/conference.php" target="_blank">2012 American Printing History A</a>ssociation Conference was held at Columbia College, near Chicago’s original Printer’s Row, and was host to 175 attendees this year. Considering the city’s rich history in the printing and design field dating back to the 1880s, Chicago was an excellent location for this event. Attendees had the opportunity to learn about local legends such as the historic <a href="http://www.magazineart.org/main.php/v/trade/inlandprinter/" target="_blank">Inland Printer Magazine</a> and the Union Type Foundry, as well as the pioneering binderies and engravers, and the huge printing plants built by R.R. Donnelly and Rand McNally. The Chicago region was also home to the Ludlow and Vandercook Companies and famous type designers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Bruce_Cooper" target="_blank">Oswald Cooper</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Goudy" target="_blank">Frederic W. Goudy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Hunter_Middleton" target="_blank">Robert Hunter Middleton</a>.</div>

<div></div>
<div>The first night of the conference kicked-off with a screening of <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/makingfaces.html" target="_blank">”Making Faces</a>,” a film about the late James Rimmer, who was the proprietor of a print studio and foundry in Canada where he designed and produced his own typefaces. The painstakingly detailed process of creating letterforms and typefaces is an astounding craft to witness. The film screening was hosted by <a href="http://www.newberry.org/" target="_blank">The Newberry Library</a> and coincided with the launch of their new exhibition, <a href="http://www.newberry.org/newberrys-125th-anniversary" target="_blank">”The Newberry 125</a>”. The exhibition features stunning artifacts such as a copy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours" target="_blank">Book of Hours</a>, circa 1450, and original Rand McNally maps from 1919.</div>

<div></div>
<div>While it was alternately sunny and windy, with a delightful absence of rain, a handful of my fellow conference goers and I gathered in the morning for a walking tour of Printer’s Row with type designer Jackson Cavanaugh, of the design studio <a href="http://okaytype.com/hello/friend" target="_blank">Okay Type</a>. We followed Jackson along a fact-filled few blocks where we learned much about the history of this Midwest printing hub.</div>
<div>One of the interesting facts learned on the tour is that the big printing houses were set-up in 6 or 7 story buildings and practiced a top-down production process, literally. Counter intuitively, the heavy presses were located on the very top floor where typesetters had access to the best light for composing page after page of type for jobs like the Sears catalog. It’s awe inspiring just to imagine setting an entire catalog like that by hand!  From the beginning of a print project on the top floor, the work moved down floor by floor, to the bindery and on to finishing before being loaded out the back door and onto the train, to be shipped to destinations nationwide. Today the buildings are home to condo-dwellers, but still stand as a great reminder of the historic past.</div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div>The conference also hosted a book fair, workshops and demos and library visits before the banquet and address from the keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.aiga.org/medalist-rickvalicenti/" target="_blank">Rick Valicenti</a>. Valicenti is noted for winning the 2011 National Design Award in Communication Design from the Smithsonian’s <a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org/" target="_blank">Cooper Hewitt</a>, National Design Museum. His talk explored the question: What does type mean to us? Valicenti proclaimed that design encapsulates the moment of its creation and offered insightful examples. The first example of art encapsulating the moment was a <a href="http://www.impawards.com/1972/posters/super_fly_xlg.jpg" target="_blank">Superfly poster</a> from the 1970s. Much about the period of time that it was created in is communicated in the typography, graphic style and printing technology used to produce it. It certainly is a kind of time capsule that offers a glimpse into the past.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a href="http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-305" alt="007" src="http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007-1024x1024.jpg" width="980" height="980" srcset="http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007-100x100.jpg 100w, http://www.mischievo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/007.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<div>Another of Valicenti’s examples was a photo of a picket sign from the teachers’ strike in Chicago that took place the previous week. Valicenti pondered whether or not the person who made the sign knew that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Black" target="_blank">Cooper Black</a> typeface they chose was designed in Chicago in 1922 by Oswald Cooper? Or, he pondered, was it simply the fattest font they could find to get their point across? There are so many layers of meaning to discover imbedded into the myriad design decisions we make, some of which we are conscious of, and others that we are not. It is interesting to think about what the designs and the technology we are using today will say about this period of time <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1149617333"><span>50 years from now</span></span>.</div>
<div>The last day of the conference boasted an impressive lineup of 14 amazing speakers, ranging from historians to designers. The highlights were <a href="http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/" target="_blank">Paul Shaw</a>, editor of Codex Magazine, <a href="http://print.rit.edu/authors/show/24" target="_blank">Frank Romano</a>, prolific author, and <a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=105522" target="_blank">Stan Knight</a>, internationally known calligrapher and author.</div>

<div>Paul Shaw, who is also a letter artist, author, Design Historian and Professor at both <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/" target="_blank">Parsons School of Design</a> and <a href="http://www.sva.edu/" target="_blank">School of Visual Arts</a> shared the history of Fred Goudy &amp; Oswald Cooper in his presentation. He related how they got their start at the Holme School of Illustration in Chicago, and their subsequent careers in type design and illustration. Paul posits that the beginning of graphic design was born from the advertising industry in the 1890’s. His presentation would be enjoyed by any student of graphic design, and I was left wishing that he had been my teacher back in college!</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Frank J. Romano, author of IP’s <a href="http://www.internationalpaper.com/US/EN/Business/CPIP/PocketPal.html" target="_blank">Pocket Pal</a> as well as many other books, is President of <a href="http://museumofprinting.org/" target="_blank">The Museum of Printing</a> in North Andover, Massachusetts. Mr. Romano is amazing! My only regret at his presentation is that I didn’t have my Pocket Pal handy for an autograph.  Romano is a walking encyclopedia of everything that has anything to do with printing. He showed us almost every crazy machine that was ever used to set type post-linotype and pre-current digital age.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Stan Knight undertook the monumental effort of getting high quality images taken from libraries across the world so that anyone can actually see the examples of early letterform design. The book was recently published and I, for one, can’t wait to get my hands on a copy: <a href="http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=105522" target="_blank">Historical Types from Gutenberg to Ashendene</a>.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The attendees of APHA comprised a wide cross-section of people with varied yet similar interests. At dinner I chatted with book artists, librarians, library science and graphic design grad students, museum directors, teachers and type designers both young and old. The common thread that connects us all is books and the ingredients necessary to create them.</div>

<div>The consistent theme over the course of the weekend was looking forward into the past. Printing has a rich history, and while we are all trying to keep pace with the ever changing technology for the last 100 years, it is important to keep looking back at what came before. In looking back we see that there is much that we do, and how and why we do it, that remains the same.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Librarians and museums are archiving the historical artifacts of printing technology so that educators and researchers and students will continue to have access to the accumulated knowledge. Book artists and type designers are looking to the past for inspiration and using a hybrid of new and old technologies to tell their stories. As a graphic designer, book artist and a printer, the history of my profession is the history of printing and I was humbled and inspired to be a surrounded by so many people that care about preserving and protecting that history for the future.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Full disclosure: The first time I attempted this project there was some throwing involved. I seriously could not grok the step where you carefully construct the base of the house, and the direction that the flaps flap in is of utmost importance.</p>
<p><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4pkjkwlpfLg/Tz7aFZb7Z3I/AAAAAAAAASo/8U2bjsYOEVE/s1600/72houses5.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4pkjkwlpfLg/Tz7aFZb7Z3I/AAAAAAAAASo/8U2bjsYOEVE/s320/72houses5.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Months passed before I brought myself to attempting this project again. On my second attempt, (preceded by a few deep breaths and a little patience), I finally got it. It&#8217;s really not that hard. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Playing-Books-Upcycling-Deconstructing-Reimagining/dp/159253600X" target="_blank">I encourage you to try it</a>, and if you are not paper-geek inclined I am happy to make them for you (for a wee fee of course).</p>
<p>There is something cozy about these little paper houses. Lined up along a windowsill, on the mantle, or anywhere that need a little more cozy!</p>
